## Problem Definition

Extract and summarize monologue audio to assist note-takers.

## Proposed Solution

Build an application that generates a Summary of Speech (Lectures, Podcasts, News Reports, and other speeches and monologues). We could leverage pre-trained models to transcribe, segment, and summarize the audio. The project would allow us to design, develop, and deploy scalable pipelines that combine speech-to-text models with summarization techniques.
 
## Project Scope
 
- Monologue Speech
- Extractive Summaries

### Level 1

Assume automatic transcript is available from an existing service
Focus on segmentation, summarization, and extraction pipelines

### Level 2
Assume only audio file is available
Focus on ASR, error correction, segmentation and summarization pipelines
