Wave function basic and equation and for equation predict what's gonna have next.

Yes, or no. Just those two possibilities no in between. So if you're you have a magnetic field that is oriented vertically.

So in quantum mechanics, what we say is that it's not that we don't know whether the electron has been clockwise or down as loved ones. It can be in a super position about that's just the thin version of the position of the electron can be spread out in a in a way. Right? It's it's truly not just that we are lacking some knowledge that the knowledge really isn't there. And again, this is how we teach quantum mechanics and textbooks. And then I'm gonna correct it, just as many worlds is much better. But this is a standard textbook version. There's a way function, the way function for a spin and see it's either up or down or some combination. And then there's a rule that says when you measure this thing, you only get up or down. You don't see the way function. Just like the cloud that you have for the electron decision, when you look at it, you see it at a location. So another way, if make the same argument is, take a little piece of... I have a nice little image this leg talks, little piece of uranium. So it's a radioactive act little chunk of metal. And you put it in a bubble chamber So it is submitting radioactive particles and you detect the particles. You won't see a little streak of of motion with the park belief. You uranium them okay. Well, like I said, when you're not looking at it, this electron is supposed to obey equation it's a short. And you can ask what the prediction is when is gonna radioactive nucleus sdk and gives off an electrons. What is this wave function than it is. What is the weight function electron is gonna be? The answer is it goes off in a spherical way. It goes off in all directions the ones, even... Yes. All direction evenly. But you never see that. Is that probably based on a shape of the piece of uranium, this is vary? No. Because the electron gets from one individual nucleus of it that. Right? So the... What the... The ringing is doing doesn't matter. Just like one atom of matters. And the easiest thing for the electron to do is just to go out and doesn't have doing higher energy case. But the point is it's not going on the straight loss. But when you look at it, you see a straight line. Right? That's the fundamental mystery one that we that how we describe the thing when we're not looking at it is different than what we see when we look at.
